Building and Installing

  * Find your installed apxs, usually in /usr/bin, or /usr/local/apache/bin.

  * Call apxs -c mod_ocaml.c to compile the module

  * Copy the created file mod_ocaml.so to your apache libexec directory,
    e. g. /usr/local/apache/libexec.

  * Make two entries in your httpd.conf configuration file:

    LoadModule mod_ocaml mod_ocaml.so
    AddHandler ocaml-parsed .ocml

  * Restart your apache web server. Now it is ready to process your
    OCML-files.
